Once you have run the $INSTALL job and completed the steps in the
$IVP member, you may follow these procedures to finish the install
of the libraries.

* Review the members in MA133.TSO.PARMLIB and customize accordingly.

* Merge in the ISRCMDS command table in MA133.TSO.ISPTLIB with your
  ISPF site command table. You can view the entries in this table
  by following the $IVP member to logon using the CATLIBS exec. Once
  in ISPF, go to the Commands Utility, usually option 3.9. View the
  ISR command table to see what's in there.

* If you plan to use CATLIBS to allocate your TSO libraries at logon
  time, review the members in MA133.TSO.LOGON.PARMLIB:
  > Add in any product libraries necessary. Use member MA133 as a
    model. Ensure that MA133 is included in the @BASIC driver.
  > Update the @BASIC member to add in any of the product members you
    created in the previous step that you want allocated to all users.
  > Create any necessary unique driver members you need (for regular
    users, operators, developers, system programmers etc). Copy the
    @SPECIAL member as a model.
  > Review the #BASIC start command members to make any necessary
    changes. Create new members as needed and refer to them in the
    driver members created in the previous step.
  > Review member $PRC2DRV to create a tso proc name to driver mapping.
  > Edit MA133.TSO.LOGON(CATLIBS) and search for 'global'. There is a
    small section of global variables to review here.
  > Update your TSO logon procs to model the after
    MA133.TSO.SAMPLIB(TSOBASIC).

* If you do not intend to use CATLIBS, make sure the following
  libraries are allocated to the DDs indicated:
    | ISPMLIB MA133.TSO.ISPMLIB
    | ISPPLIB MA133.TSO.ISPPLIB
    | ISPTLIB MA133.TSO.ISPTLIB
    | SYSEXEC MA133.TSO.SYSEXEC

  difficulties.
