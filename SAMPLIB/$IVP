Go through the following procedures to test drive these libraries and
decide which pieces you want to use in your shop. Before proceeding you
should have run the $INSTALL job to change the HLQ used in the various
libraries. You should perform these steps before proceeding to the steps
in the $INSTAL2 member.

* Review member ISPF in MA133.TSO.LOGON.PARMLIB to make sure the ISPF
  libs refered to are correct.

* Return to the READY prompt in TSO, and enter "EX
  'MA133.TSO.LOGON(CATLIBS)'" This should start up a new ISPF session
  with these libraries allocated.

* Enter "FJ SAMPJOB" to find the sample job from SAMPLIB. This will
  test the find job command.

* While you are viewing SAMPJOB, enter ">FP" on the command line, and
  place your cursor on the SAMPPROC proclib. This should find the sample
  proc from SAMPLIB. Notice how it resolved the JCLLIB proc library.

* While you are viewing SAMPPROC, enter ">FD" on the command line, and
  place your cursor on the "DSN=&HLQ..SAMPLIB" statement. This should
  find the dataset MA133.TSO.SAMPLIB. Notice how it performed symbolic
  substitution on the dataset name.

* Enter "FR FR" to see if the find rexx program can find itself.

* End from the various nested views. If you have CA-JCLCHECK installed,
  edit MA133.TSO.SYSEXEC(NJCHECK) and review the CA-JCLCHECK parms to
  ensure they reflect your environment. Once satisfied, enter "NJ
  SAMPJOB".  If everything works, you will get a series of ISPF panels
  which break the job down into various views. Hit PF1 to get an
  explanation of the tables.

* Go to the Search-For application in ISPF (usually 3.14). On the
  lower right hand corner, ensure that 'Output Mode' is set to 'View'.
  Search a library for a string you know exists. On the search results
  list, enter 'KEYS' and set an available PFKEY to 'SRCHGO'. Enter
  this PFKEY on any of the search results lines. This should view
  the dataset on the correct line. See the SRCHGO exec for more.

* Enter 'SS DSL' to get a dataset list screen using the STARTUP exec.
  Enter 'SS PROC1' to edit 'SYS1.PROCLIB'. Enter 'SS' by itself to
  see your ISPF sessions. Exit that screen and enter 'SS DSL' to
  return to the dataset list screen. Enter 'SS /' to view your
  shortcut table. See the end of the STARTUP exec for more details.

* Proceed to the $INSTAL2 member to complete the install.
