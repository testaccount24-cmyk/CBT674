* sample ftppds profile
* this is an alternate method of downloading my product libs directly
* without having to use the xmit dataset. see ftppds in sysexec.
* to execute enter "tso ftppds 'ma133.tso.samplib(ftppdsr)'"
* the only trouble is i don't have an anonymous ftp account, so this
* won't work. to test this out tho, you could send the datasets to
* an ftp site using the ftppdss member, then receive it with this.
