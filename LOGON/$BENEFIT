Here are some underlying benefits of using these parmlibs:

* This method is quite efficient for allocating custom libraries. Some
  methods require that all libs be allocated first, after which they are
  examined, freed, then reallocated with custom libs ahead of the
  original.  In many cases (depending on how you are reallocating) this
  can only be done one library at a time, so if you have several libs to
  be allocated for the same DD, the same free-and-reallocate process
  must be performed multiple times.

* CATLIBS is much more customizable for each user than many other
  methods.  The number and variety of logon procs can be reduced since
  we can customize a special environment for each user if necessary.

* If a DSN in an include member is misspelled, accidentally deleted,
  exclusively enqueued, or otherwise unavailable, this procedure will
  recover from the condition and reallocate the DD, removing the
  offending datasets from the concatenation. This will allow you to
  logon despite problems with individual datasets. Provided the basic
  datasets are available, you'll still be able to get to the system,
  which means more availability, and gives you peace of mind in a
  disaster recovery scenerio.

* Product libraries are grouped into nice packages in separate members
  of this parmlib. Removing a product from a logon proc is as simple as
  commenting the include statement in the driver member. Other methods
  require you to make updates in various areas, and the risk is high
  that you'll make a mistake causing a JCL error at logon, or leave in a
  library somewhere that should have been removed.

* It helps to document what libraries correspond to what product. I
  discovered, for instance, that we had LANRES datasets allocated to our
  logon procs simply because that's what came with the system and it was
  difficult to track down what the datasets were for. We don't use
  LANRES and therefore don't need them allocated. Having product
  parmlibs helps to self-document all datasets that are in use.

* Only those products you actually use will be allocated to your logon
  proc. It's senseless for Joe-user to have system programmer libraries
  allocated!  This allows you to assign libraries more easily based on
  their use.
