THESE UTILITIES ARE PROVIDED AS IS WITH NO WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES OF
ANY KIND WHATSOEVER. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

these are little utilities and useful tools i have built over the years.
they are free to anyone who wants to use them. the ZOOM exec i don't
take any credit for, it was downloaded from www.cbttape.org, file 671.
i distribute it here with a couple of mods since i use it in one or two
of my other execs.

if you have any questions or problems with these execs, please contact
me at the address below.

they have been tested using os/390 2.10. i will be testing them using
z/os 1.4 as soon as possible. i'd be happy to help get them working at
other levels and would appreciate any suggestions for improvement or any
other feedback.
